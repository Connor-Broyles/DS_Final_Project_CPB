# DS_Final_Project_CPB - The Predictive Analytics of eSports
## Connor Broyles
### DS-450-01 Spring 2024

#### In this project I will explore the world of professional eSports in the online computer game Valorant. I will aim to create a robust model that allows the intake of proessional Valorant play data to be used in order to predict overall helpful statistics to help guide players and viewers into which professionals they would wnat to pick and watch for fantasy leagues. This project will allow people who have never seen VCT and people who are long time VCT veterans to bond over fantasy league for professional Valorant play.
